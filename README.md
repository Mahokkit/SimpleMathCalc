Simple Math Calculator - This is for my Mobile Application Development Course at NSCC Institute of Technology

(turn out... it wasn't very simple, mostly cause I want it to work like a real calculator)

Sept 26, 2017
everything works.... kind of except the following
- can't do 1 + 1 x 3 and etc
- can't put negative back to positive, if user press +/- the second time
- backspace works, but unless it's fully empty... it will crash.

Suggestion and feedback are welcome.
